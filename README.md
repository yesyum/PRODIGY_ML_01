# Prodigy Infotech Internship 


This readme file provides a comprehensive overview of the projects completed during the internship at Prodigy Infotech. Each project focused on different aspects of data science and machine learning. Below, you will find details about each task, the approach taken, and the directory structure for easy navigation.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for predicting house prices using linear regression. The dataset used includes various features such as living area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total rooms.

## Code Highlights
- Data exploration and visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Log transformation of the target variable (`SalePrice`) for better model performance.
- Testing feature normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
- Training a linear regression model on the original and log-transformed data.
- Evaluation of the model using Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R2-squared.
- Visualization of model predictions compared to actual prices.

## Results
The linear regression model shows reasonable predictive performance. Predicted sale prices are transformed back from the logarithmic scale for interpretability.
